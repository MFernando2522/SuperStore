// 1. Try to extend Toy â€” what happens and why?

// 3. Add a method to Electronics called warrantyInfo() and mark it final
//ok done in electronics class on line uhhh 83!

// 4. Use access modifiers appropriately and explain your choices in comments
//ok, I mainly used public cause it was the least restrictive,
// and in them I use a jumble of private and protected cause I dont want other classes outside the ones I made access my variables
//UNLESS i soecifically say in the initalization to access them
//For example, productId needed to be final cause it doesnt change
//But uhhhh something like price its protected, not changed by outside forces but by company (or when tariffs hit and the switch 2 is 450 dollars why)
//i think i answered this well huzzah!
